# data_mining_sent_analysis

Eleftherios Bolkas

This is a project made for a Data Mining course in the Department of Informatics and Telecommunications in the National And Kapodistrian University of Athens.

In this project, I created classifiers that classify tweets based on their sentiment on COVID-19 vaccines(positive, neutral and negative). The Python Notebook(vacc_sentiment_analysis.ipynb file) contains the whole project, including presentation of the project and detailed explanation of its implementation(in greek). The notebook is already run on a set of tweets and all the data analysis and the results of the classification are presented in the notebook. Most of the source code is additionally included in the src folder.

The project consists of preprocessing the data, analyzing the data, feature extraction, topic modeling(LDA), building classifiers and evaluating the models. Three classifiers are tested: SVM, Random Forests and KNN. The analysis and the results are presented in diagrams and tables in the notebook.
